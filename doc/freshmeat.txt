Fixed a bug in conditional evaluation that twadmin(8) tickled.  Better
detection of pure inclusions. Better blank-section elimination.
Kleene star recognized as ... synonym in command synopses.  Correct
some bugs in semantic-hint collection.  Recognize Qt manual pages and
use their conventions.  Better lifting of mandoc-generated
pages. Translate groff-style \[...] escapes, flag unknown ones.  Can
now parse K&R style function prototypes as well as ANSI ones. This
version lifts 96% of 9829 manual pages in a full Red Hat 9
installation with Fedora updates to *validated* XML-DocBook.
