
Things That Need to be Done
---------------------------

- Invalid schemas should not be accepted without warnings:
  + Columns without a type should be warned
  + varchar, decimal etc. without a size should be warned.
  + Too long object names should be warned.
  + Relations to tables/columns that don't exist should be warned.
  + key="n" values that repeat should be warned (ie. two or more columns with the same N in the same table)

- To test:
  + Warnings of the above conditions
  + Keys="n" out of order are still put in correct order

- Enumerations - I think this would be really cool:
  + Ability to put enumeration on a column with option to put a constraint on it.
  + Enumerations should have value="1" name="Name" desc="Description" default="true"
  + where name is mandatory, value is assumed name if value missing. Default changes the columns default.

- Check constraints - todo

- Unique constraint - todo

- Triggers - todo

- Lint of Schema the ability to check the schema for:
  + Not following naming conventions (of your choosing)
  + Column types that repeat more than 3 times without using a dictionary
  + Non portable data types (like varchar2)
  + Un-indexed tables

- Allow some alias name for columns. Like column and columns for relations

- Order the DDLs by dependancies.

- Ordering of table columns to match ordering in XML
